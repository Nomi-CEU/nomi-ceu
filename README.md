[![Curseforge](http://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_594351_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/nomi-ceu)  
Port of [Nomifactory](https://github.com/Nomifactory/Nomifactory) 1.3 to the [GregTech CE Unofficial](https://github.com/GregTechCEu/GregTech) generation of GT mods, with updated quests, progression and minor balance changes to adapt to CEu's changes.  
- Overhauled circuit progression closely following CEu stock   
- Multiblock versions of nearly all machines, including EBF, Freezer and DT, processing up to 256 recipes in parallel  
- New processing chains for Naquadah, Advanced SMDs, Crystal Chips, and more  
- Fixed lots of unpleasant CE-ness - fixed infinite Amp bug, different ore stone types don't clog up your inventory, etc.   
- Super-performant emissive effects on machines, coil blocks, the Fusion Reactor, and more  
- Updated questbook to guide you through all the new stuff, including a completely new chapter, the Processing Lines Tab, to give you more info, useful tips and a visual representation of different processing lines, both new and old  
- lots more...

\* Note: If you are adding these mods via the CurseForge app, remove the copy of non-Extended Life AE2 it might automatically download.

## Hard mode info
If you want a harder, or perhaps a more "true" GregTech experience, check out the Expert mode. This pack mode is based on the [Self-Torture Edition fork](https://github.com/NotMyWing/Omnifactory-Self-Torture-Edition) of the original pack. Highlights include:

- No DME for easy infinite resources   
- Nomicoins can't be spent  
- The Steam Age  
- No Creative Tank; instead...  
- Stabilized Micro Miners for late-game infinite resources  
- Harder recipes for assorted things like Iridium, Graphene, Numismatic Dynamos, and more  

Installation instructions:
- Install the hardmode config files from [here](https://github.com/tracer4b/nomi-ceu/tree/main/overrides). Restart the pack for this to take effect. 
  - Windows users may grab the utility [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracer4b/nomi-ceu/main/pack-mode-switcher.bat)(right click - save as), save it to the root directory of the pack (the same level as `\config`).   
  - MacOS and GNU/Linux users can run `curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tracer4b/nomi-ceu/main/pack-mode-switcher.sh | sh` in the pack root directory (the one containing `/config`).  
- If you are on an existing world, run `/bq_admin default load` to load the hard mode questbook.
