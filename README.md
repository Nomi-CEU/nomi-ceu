## Contributing and Maintainer Information
This is available on our [wiki](https://github.com/Nomi-CEu/Nomi-CEu/wiki).

## Server Setup and Information
Details on how to setup a basic server, and some important server admin information, are listed [here.](https://github.com/Nomi-CEu/Nomi-CEu/blob/main/serverfiles/README.md)

## Addon Mods
Nomi-CEu comes with addon scripts for the following mods. You can drop them into the mods folder, and their recipes will be adjusted accordingly.  
- [AE2 Fluid Crafting Rework](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ae2-fluid-crafting-rework)  
- [Compact Machines](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/compact-machines)  
- [Flux Networks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flux-networks)  
- [Lazy AE2](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lazy-ae2)  
- [Project Red - Illumination](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/project-red-illumination)    

\* Note: If you are adding these mods via the CurseForge app, remove the extra copy of AE2 (non-extended life), of which it might automatically download.

## Expert Mode 
If you want a harder, or perhaps a more "true" GregTech experience, check out the Expert mode. This pack mode is based on the [Self-Torture Edition Fork](https://github.com/NotMyWing/Omnifactory-Self-Torture-Edition) of the original pack. 

### Highlights include:
- Forced Peaceful Mode
- No DME for easy infinite resources
- Nomicoins can't be spent, or obtained
- The Steam Age
- More Focus on GT Power Generation
- No Creative Tank; instead...
    - Stabilized Micro Miners for late-game infinite resources  
- Harder recipes for assorted things like Iridium, Graphene, Numismatic Dynamos, and more  

### Installation Instructions:
\* Note: Scripts will not work on versions <1.6, thus manual installation will be necessary. 

#### Script Installation Instructions:
------
##### Windows:   
 - Download the script [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nomi-CEu/Nomi-CEu/main/pack-mode-switcher.bat), and save it to the root directory of the pack (the same level as `\config`).
 - Run the pack mode switcher in a terminal with `./pack-mode-switcher.bat`

##### Apple/GNU/Linux:    
 - Run `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nomi-CEu/Nomi-CEu/main/pack-mode-switcher.sh` to download the file.
 - Verify the contents with your editor of choice.
 - Run `chmod +x pack-mode-switcher.sh; sh pack-mode-switcher.sh` in the pack root directory (the one containing `/config`).
------

#### Manual installation instructions are available [here](https://github.com/Nomi-CEu/Nomi-CEu/blob/main/overrides/README.md).

## Bansoukou
This pack uses two bansoukou patches. 
The first one is for [NuclearCraft](https://github.com/tomdodd4598/NuclearCraft/tree/1.12.2), and the second one is for [Draconic Evolution](https://github.com/Draconic-Inc/Draconic-Evolution/tree/1.12.2).

The two patch repos are:
- [NuclearCraft](https://github.com/Exaxxion/NuclearCraft/tree/2.18y-ceu). This fixes GTCEu incompatability with NuclearCraft.
- [Draconic Evolution](https://github.com/Nomi-CEu/Draconic-Evolution). This adds the destruct core button, and allows GT blocks in place of DE blocks in the Energy Core and Reactor.

If there are issues or crashes with Draconic Evolution, please report them to [here](https://github.com/Nomi-CEu/Draconic-Evolution/issues) instead of the main Draconic Evolution repo.
